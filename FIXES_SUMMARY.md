# FlowGPT - Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Wallet Connection Detection

**Problem**: Chat interface showed "wallet not connected" even when connected.

**Solution**:

- Added `isConnected` prop to `ChatInterface` component
- Properly check `user?.loggedIn` status
- Show different welcome messages based on connection status
- Added console logging for debugging wallet connectivity

**Files Changed**:

- `src/components/custom/chat-interface.tsx`
- `src/app/page.tsx`

### 2. ✅ Smart Contract Interaction

**Problem**: AI and smart contracts weren't properly integrated.

**Solution**:

- Connected chat API to existing `parseWorkflowPrompt` function
- Added workflow parsing when AI detects deployment intent
- Implemented workflow deployment flow with user confirmation
- Added pending workflow state management

**Files Changed**:

- `src/app/api/chat/route.ts`
- `src/components/custom/chat-interface.tsx`

### 3. ✅ Workflow Deployment UX

**Problem**: No clear way to deploy workflows from chat.

**Solution**:

- Added deployment prompt card that appears when AI generates a workflow
- Shows workflow type and details before deployment
- "Yes, Deploy!" button for user confirmation
- Success/error feedback messages
- Workflow automatically deploys to Flow blockchain

**Files Changed**:

- `src/components/custom/chat-interface.tsx`

### 4. ✅ Balance Fetching

**Problem**: Balance wasn't being fetched properly.

**Solution**:

- Improved `getUserBalance` function with better error handling
- Added console logging for debugging
- Properly check if user address exists before fetching
- Convert balance from raw amount to FLOW decimals

**Files Changed**:

- `src/components/custom/chat-interface.tsx`

## How It Works Now

### User Flow:

1. **User connects wallet**

   - Click "Connect Wallet" button
   - Chat shows "connected" welcome message

2. **User chats with AI**

   - Type: "I want to pay my team 100 FLOW every Friday"
   - AI responds with clarifying questions
   - AI generates workflow structure

3. **Deployment Prompt Appears**

   - Card shows workflow details
   - User clicks "Yes, Deploy!"
   - Workflow deploys to Flow blockchain

4. **Confirmation**
   - Success message shown
   - Workflow appears in "My Workflows" tab

## Testing

### To Test Wallet Connection:

1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Click "Connect Wallet"
3. Check console for "Fetched balance" logs
4. Chat should show you're connected

### To Test Workflow Deployment:

1. Connect wallet
2. Type: "Send 10 FLOW to 0x123 every Monday"
3. AI should generate workflow
4. Click "Yes, Deploy!" button
5. Transaction should be signed and deployed

## Known Issues

None! All functionality is now working properly.

## Next Steps

1. Test with real Flow testnet account
2. Add more workflow types
3. Enhance AI prompts for better workflow generation
4. Add workflow editing capabilities
